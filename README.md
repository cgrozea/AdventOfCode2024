# [Advent Of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) - My solutions in the [Picat Language](http://picat-lang.org/)

I learn this language during the competition, so I need to use the [Picat user guide](http://picat-lang.org/download/picat_guide.pdf) every time.

Picat is derived from Prolog, so it makes backtracking easy, but it also supports efficient search with integration of SAT and CP engines, as well as tabling, which often turns automatically exponential time recursive code into polynomial time dynamic programming execution.

Other repos to look at for the AOC2024 solutions in Picat:
